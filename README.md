# Prerequisites
<ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">you have to open an account for organizing your photos</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">A whenhub access token is needed to create and organize your whenhub albums </li></ul>
# How I built it
I have used php, javascript, bootstrap, jquery, mysql, ajax and some opensource libraries to develop this application. Whenhub API has been used to create, delete, upload and organize users' albums and photos. Picast ask user "whenhub access token" for creating a schedule named Picast-Albums.  Users can create multiple albums(events) in that created schedule of whenhub and can add photos(media in whenhub events)  to their albums. Picast is made user friendly. Update, delete, edit and sharing facilities have been included along with the options of following other users' photos and albums.     

# Challenges I ran into
At first I have faced some problems in implementing whenhub API. I am very thankful that "Whenhub Support"  has helped me to solve those problems. Picast is one of my first web-app. So, I had to learn different web languages and their formats from the beginner level. And due to limited time I couldn't implement some more features.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Picast will help people to share and whencast their dreams and memories. And after a long time they will cherished with their preserved albums in the picast.
